## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a simple chatbot and deploy it on a web-page using "Flask".
The bot was created using Pytorch and exemplifies how a neural net works. The project overall is very simple and provides a understanding of these subjects.




## Process
- Create a JSON file with the intends;
- Transform these words to a language the machine can understand;
- Apply neural net;
- Create a train file and check if the results are valid;
- Add the chatbot to a webpage using Flask as backend;


## Results
After training the bot and implementing Flask:


     
We named the bot as "Helo" and she was trained to understand questions asked in Portuguese:

## Learning Process

### Theory Applied
- [x] Numpy
- [x] Pytorch
- [x] Neural Nets
- [x] Flask

### Challenges
- Training the bot to understand the words was challenging, especially because Portuguese have some special characters like (^~`Â´).

### Improvements
 - The JSON file does not have much info, we could improve this in order to get better responses from the bot.
